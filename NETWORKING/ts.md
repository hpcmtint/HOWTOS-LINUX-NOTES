The `netstat` command is not directly available on macOS. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a combination of commands:

**Alternatives for netstat -ntlp on macOS**

1. **`lsof -i`:** This command lists all open files, including network sockets. To get output similar to `netstat -ntlp`, you can use:

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN
```

This will show all listening TCP and UDP ports, their process IDs (PIDs), and the names of the processes.

2. **`netstat` (with limitations):** macOS does have a `netstat` command, but it doesn't have all the options available in Linux. You can still use it to get some basic information, such as:

```bash
netstat -an | grep LISTEN 
```

This will list all listening sockets with their numerical addresses and port numbers.

**Additional Tips**

* **Process Names:** To get the full process name instead of just the PID, you can pipe the output of `lsof` to `grep` like this:

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep -v grep
```

* **Specific Ports:** To see information about a specific port, use `grep` to filter the output:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
```

This will show processes listening on port 80.

**Key Differences from netstat -ntlp**

The macOS alternatives don't offer the exact same output as `netstat -ntlp` on Linux. Here's a summary of the key differences:

| Feature       | netstat -ntlp | macOS Alternatives |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Listening ports | ✅              | ✅                   |
| Protocol (TCP/UDP)  | ✅              | ✅                   |
| Local address | ✅              | ✅                   |
| Foreign address   | ✅              | ❌                   |
| PID            | ✅              | ✅                   |
| Program name    | ✅              | ✅ (with additional grep) |
| State           | ✅              | ❌                   |
